## What Does This Tool Do?

RedTeam Inspector helps you find security issues in web applications by:
- Finding sensitive data like API keys and tokens
- Detecting 2FA/authentication implementations
- Monitoring memory for data leaks
- Tracking event listeners and network calls
- Analyzing client-side security

## üöÄ New Features Explained

### Progressive Scanning
- Scans in small chunks to keep the browser responsive
- Shows real-time progress bar
- Automatically manages memory usage
- Can be paused/resumed anytime

### 2FA Analysis
- Finds two-factor authentication code
- Shows potential bypass opportunities
- Lists all authentication paths
- Helps identify implementation flaws

### Smart Exports
- "Export Critical" - Just the important findings
- "Export Full" - Complete scan results
- Saves as JSON files for easy sharing
- Includes severity scores

## üì¶ Installation

Copy and paste this in your browser console:
```javascript
(function(){
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leb-ben/redteam-inspector/main/redteam-inspector.min.js';
    document.head.appendChild(script);
})();
```

## üéØ How to Use

### Basic Steps:
1. Load the script (see Installation)
2. Look for the red dot panel (üî¥) in top-right
3. Choose what you want to do:
   - Find sensitive data ‚Üí "Object Scan" tab
   - Test 2FA ‚Üí "2FA Analysis" tab
   - Monitor network ‚Üí "Intercepted" tab
   - Check events ‚Üí "Event Listeners" tab
   - See statistics ‚Üí "Statistics" tab

### Finding Sensitive Data:
1. Go to "Object Scan" tab
2. Watch the progress bar
3. Look for items highlighted in teal
4. Click items to see details
5. Use search to filter results

### Testing 2FA:
1. Go to "2FA Analysis" tab
2. Start a scan
3. Look for authentication patterns
4. Check implementation details
5. Export findings for reports

### Memory Management:
1. Watch the progress bar
2. Export regularly on big sites
3. Cancel scan if needed
4. Clear results to free memory

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Basic Settings
```javascript
window.redteamInspector.CONFIG = {
    // How deep to scan
    maxDepth: 10,
    
    // How many results to keep
    maxResults: 5000,
    
    // How fast to scan
    chunkSize: 10,
    scanDelay: 0,
    
    // What to look for
    sensitivePatterns: /token|key|password|secret|auth|2fa|otp/i
};
```

### UI Settings
```javascript
window.redteamInspector.UI_CONFIG = {
    // Colors
    theme: {
        primary: '#20b2aa',    // Teal
        secondary: '#40e0d0'   // Turquoise
    }
};
```

## üîí Security Notes

### For Safe Usage:
- Always get permission first
- Export findings regularly
- Clear results after testing
- Monitor memory usage
- Use on test environments when possible

### What to Watch For:
- API keys and tokens
- Hardcoded passwords
- 2FA implementation flaws
- Memory leaks
- Exposed endpoints
- Client-side validation issues

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### If the Tool Freezes:
1. Click "Cancel Scan"
2. Reduce chunk size
3. Export and restart

### If Memory Usage is High:
1. Export current findings
2. Clear results
3. Continue scanning

### If Can't Find Data:
1. Check search patterns
2. Increase scan depth
3. Try different starting points
